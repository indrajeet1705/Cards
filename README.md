# Pokémon Cards Project

This is a beginner-level project showcasing Pokémon-themed cards using HTML and CSS. Each card represents a popular Pokémon with an image and some styling effects. The project demonstrates basic web development concepts, including layout, styling, and hover interactions.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The cards are styled to center-align within the page.
- **Unique Pokémon Cards**: Each card is styled with distinct colors and a slight rotation effect.
- **Interactive Hover Effect**: Hovering over a card brings it to the front.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout design.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage and references the CSS file.
- `style.css`: Contains the styles and animations for the cards.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Demo

Here’s what you will see:

1. Four Pokémon cards stacked with unique styles.
2. Hover over a card to see it pop out on top of the stack.

## Pokémon Represented

- **Pikachu**
- **Charmander**

## Future Enhancements

- Add a description or name overlay for each card.
- Make the layout fully responsive for different screen sizes.
